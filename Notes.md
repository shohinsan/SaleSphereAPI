Polymorphism means that a piece of code
changes its behavior solely depending upon
the concrete data it is operating on.

Interfaces in go mean a method set of behavior

A polimorphic function , interface type ^

as long as it exhibits the same behavior

Generics in go allow us to write polymorphic functions

Difference, it's no longer runtime time, it's compile
we now know what concrete type we are working with


Cluster is a compute environment that we have for running all our software we need to run
We are going to exist and live in the scope of this cluster. 
Now, the cluster is useless without Nodes. Nodes are what gives the cluster a compute power. Memory and CPU.
In production, we should have at least 3 nodes.

Docker VM that's driving this cluster.

The next thing we need to define here is a POD. 

The pod is a way of managing the different application that we wanna run in the cluster.

The entire Kubernetes system is an async system.
